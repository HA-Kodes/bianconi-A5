To unit test your CustomArrayList implementation (or any other class), you typically create a separate Java class specifically for testing. This test class will contain your unit tests, which are designed to verify the functionality of your CustomArrayList methods.

Here's how you can go about it:

Steps to Create a Unit Test Class
Create a Test Class:

This test class is usually placed in a separate test folder, often under a directory like src/test/java in your project structure.

The naming convention typically involves adding "Test" as a suffix to the name of the class being tested. For example, if your class is CustomArrayList, your test class might be CustomArrayListTest.

Use a Testing Framework:

Commonly used testing frameworks in Java include JUnit and TestNG.

In this example, we'll use JUnit 5.

Example of a Test Class
CustomArrayList.java(Your Production Code)
java
public class CustomArrayList<E> {
    // Your CustomArrayList implementation
}
CustomArrayListTest.java(Your Test Code)
java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class CustomArrayListTest {

    @Test
    public void testAddElement() {
        CustomArrayList<Integer> list = new CustomArrayList<>();
        list.add(10);
        assertEquals(1, list.size());
        assertEquals(10, list.get(0));
    }

    @Test
    public void testRemoveElement() {
        CustomArrayList<Integer> list = new CustomArrayList<>();
        list.add(10);
        list.remove(0);
        assertEquals(0, list.size());
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsEmpty() {
        CustomArrayList<Integer> list = new CustomArrayList<>();
        assertTrue(list.isEmpty());
        list.add(10);
        assertFalse(list.isEmpty());
    }
}
Explanation

Test Class Creation:
CustomArrayListTest is the test class for CustomArrayList.
It is placed in a separate test folder.

JUnit 5 Annotations:
@Test: Indicates that the method is a test case.

assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse:
Used to assert expected outcomes.

Test Methods:
testAddElement: Tests adding an element to the list.
testRemoveElement: Tests removing an element from the list.
testIsEmpty: Tests if the list is empty or not.

By following this approach, you can verify that my CustomArrayList implementation works as expected without affecting the actual production code.
Unit tests help ensure that each part of my code behaves correctly and can make my codebase more robust and maintainable.
